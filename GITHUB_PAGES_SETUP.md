# 📱 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Push to GitHub Repository

1. **Initialize Git repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Mastercard BIN Lookup application"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it `BIN-Lookup` (or your preferred name)
   - Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

3. **Push your code**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/BIN-Lookup.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar

2. **Configure Pages source**:
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Select "/docs" folder
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait for deployment**:
   - GitHub will build and deploy your site
   - This usually takes 1-5 minutes
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready
